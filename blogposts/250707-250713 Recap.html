  <h2>Recap: What Happened This Week</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Busy week at work—I knocked out a lot of projects. I keep pushing back on outdated infrastructure and nudging people forward.</li>
    <li>I created the <a href="https://matchamakes.net/projects/stationarycollection">Stationary Pens</a> page to catalogue all my fancy pens.</li>
    <li>Made serious progress on the Chris Schwarz coffer build for Harrison.</li>
    <li>Started a journal for Harrison. I want to write him letters throughout his upbringing so he’ll one day see what life was like as it happened.</li>
    <li>Ran twice this week and remembered how much I enjoy it. One run with the dogs and Harrison, one just with him—he cooed most of the way, only fussing in the last half mile (to be fair, I was ready to quit by then too).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I’m Thinking About</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">Russian Invasion of Ukraine</a></li>
    <li>RSS feels like the last bastion of the open web. #towrite</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/theodore-roosevelt-films/articles-and-essays/sound-recordings-of-theodore-roosevelts-voice/#FBM">Sound recordings of Theodore Roosevelt</a> – Fascinated hearing voices from over a century ago. </li>

  <h2>What I’m Consuming</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.penaddict.com/">Penaddict.com</a> – After a year away, I’m catching up on the podcast and blog and loving it.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ParkerNotes/search">ParkerNotes</a> – Casual videos on notebooks with light philosophy sprinkled in. Not groundbreaking, but easy watching. Introduced me to keeping lots of purpose-specific notebooks.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.katherineaddison.com/books">The Goblin Emperor</a> – Picked this back up after pausing when Harrison was born. I’ve even started reading it aloud to him at bedtime—though the names are tricky to pronounce. Recommended by <a href="https://sixcolors.com/jason/">Jason Snell</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theenthusiast.net/">The Enthusiast</a> – Myke Hurley’s new blog impressed me with its consistency and quality. An instant add to my RSS feed.</li>
    <li><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed: Everything Is Tuberculosis</em> by <a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/">John Green</a> – A quick read. Glad to support the fight against TB, but the book felt more like an extended essay than something essential.</li>
  </ul>
