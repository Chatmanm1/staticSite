<li>Recap: What Happened This Week  <ol>
<li>Busy week at work, but I nocked out a lot of projects. I continue to push back on much of the infrastructure in place at my job, and try to push people forward.  </li>
<li>I created the <a href="https://matchamakes.net/projects/stationarycollection">Stationary Pens</a> page, to catalogue all my fancy pens  that I use.</li>
<li>Had some serious progress on the <a href="https://www.finewoodworking.com/2025/02/19/chris-schwarzs-coffer-chest?srsltid=AfmBOoprzAVQk3pa8WCOvZ0u0WGrkhfppqBwRBBemPqjrsLmhsNDjb1y">Chris Schwarz</a>  coffer build for Harrison. </li>
<li>Started A journal for Harrison, I want to write him letters throughout the his upbringing so that he can get a good look into what it was like. </li>
<li>I also ran 2x this week, and really forgot how much I enjoyed it. I ran once with the dogs and Harrison and once just with Harrison, both were enjoyable. Harrison just cooed the entire time, at least till the last half mile when he got fussy. To be fair, I also was unhappy with that last bit of running and was ready to be done.</li>

<li>What I&#39;m Consuming: <ol>
<li>Penaddict.com <ol>
<li>There was about a year where i didn&#39;t listen to much of the the podcast or read much of the blog, I&#39;m catching up and loving it! </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ParkNotes: <ol>
<li>This guy writes a lot about notebooks, and shoehorns in philosophy ideals. Not greatly dense, or revolutionary, but easy watching. Introduced my to the idea of having tons of notebooks for specific things.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Goblin Emperor: <ol>
<li>I fell off reading this when Harrison came along, but I&#39;ve picked it up again and even started reading it to him at bedtime. The downside is it can be hard to pronounce some of the names outload. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Enthusiest,<ol>
<li>Recently Myke Hurley started a blog. I  was blown away by the consistency and quality. An instant ad to my RSS feed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Everything is Tuberculosis <ol>
<li>Book by John Green. I think I&#39;ve read all of John Green&#39;s books. His style isn&#39;t particularly difficult and I read this in two days. I&#39;m happy to support John and the fight against TB by purchasing this book, but I don&#39;t know if i would recommend it. It was short though so not to much of a time investment, and I did learn a few new stats about the worlds most deadly disease. </li>
