<li>What generational issues will be passed down to my child, and what can I do about  it.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What I&#39;m Making</p>
<ol>
<li>A very simple text editor for my daily todo list. I&#39;m transitioning from physical notes for work back to digital. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll go back to notecards soon, but this is a fun distraction. </li>
<li>Designed out a &quot;Pen Pillow&quot; to make out of brass.</li>
<li>Plan for pen trays, and making them a little system. So that they stack.</li>
