<li>Recap: What Happened This Week  <ol>
<li>When lifted weights this week, i was noticeably weaker. I couldn&#39;t even do some of the weights I was earlier in the month. It had been a week since i lifted so I suppose I lost a bit.</li>
<li>Baby is sudo walking, with support from me but he is getting the basic idea. Still hasn&#39;t started crawling, but he is scooching around.</li>
<li>Work projects are becoming more tedious and it&#39;s getting obnoxious. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What Iâ€™m Thinking About<ol>
<li>How can I eventually set myself up to do the work I want to do, while supporting myself and my family. </li>
<li>Humans are only like 50% of the cells that inhabit their body.</li>
<li>Old objects are storage vats for regional memories.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What I&#39;m Making</p>
<ol>
<li>Working on a run of small boxes, I&#39;m dubbing MM3, Matcha Makes 3. Since they were originally designed to hold 3 pens, but I&#39;m backtracking on some of the design elements. This will take a lot longer than i thought. </li>
<li>I recovered my A7 Midori notebook, and it was a not the best, but i do enjoy using it for the most part.</li>
<li>A lightweight Markdown editor for my own todo list.</li>
