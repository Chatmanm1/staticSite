<p>If you consider the different ways you can engage with pens and stationery—as a user, a collector, a hobbyist, a creator, a maker, a vendor—which roles fit best and what percentage of 100% would you assign to each? Are you happy with the balance?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am first and foremost a user of things. While I am dabbling into making things as a way to give back, if I am not using something with some amount of regularity I will get rid of it. I&#39;m probably flirting with the line of collector, as I am finding that the amount of stationery items I&#39;m gathering is getting larger than I would like.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is something you want to understand better or develop more informed opinions about?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve always been one to have opinions. Often they are very strong, and not well informed. I know what I like, but it is difficult to articulate the reasons why. So knowing better information about the properties and materials of pens, and inks would be incredibly beneficial. I fondly recall my Pilot Precise V5&#39;s from high school and college, and am looking for a similar experience almost always.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pen community, what&#39;s something someone has said or done that stuck with you?</p>
<ul>
<li>To my own chagrin, I can&#39;t name a singular thing the pen community has done that&#39;s stuck with me. It’s the conglomeration of so many good people and good acts that sticks with me. The inclusion, encouragement, and sage advice that keeps me coming back. I find that throughout the 10 years or so of me obtaining stationery things, when I&#39;m at my lowest I get the most involved. Always met with joy and delight, it can be a good distraction from real life.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are now 25 hours in a day, a bonus hour is available to use however you like as long as pens or stationery are involved—how do you spend your hour?</p>
<ul>
<li>I would 100% make pen trays, boxes, and pen holders. I&#39;d love to make pens, but my abilities aren&#39;t there yet, and how could I hold a candle to the work of so many great creators out there. I think I&#39;d be able to carve out a niche to help the community find even more things they like. Either that or journaling. I adore writing in my notebooks and getting my thoughts out. I can&#39;t often find the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pen community yearbook, what would your superlative be? (i.e. &quot;Best <strong>__</strong>&quot;, &quot;Most <strong>___</strong>&quot; &quot;Most likely to <strong>___</strong>&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Most likely to prefer fine writing.&quot; I almost exclusively use EF nibs, I don&#39;t write particularly small, but the thinner the line, the more I like it. My Pilot PO 743 is one of my all-time favorites, and I think that the Uniball Signo DX .28 could be finer and I&#39;d still like it.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you feel about your handwriting?</p>
<ul>
<li>…Which one? I have a curly script, a block text, and a cursive, I switch between them on each word sometimes, and have no reason why. It can sometimes make me hate the look of what I wrote. One time in school I switched styles between paragraphs. This prompted my professor to put my essay up on the projector, and ask if I was schizophrenic. Looking back, this was one of countless times teachers created mental scars in me, but I digress.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is something you are proud of doing, achieving, or overcoming?</p>
<ul>
<li>As of writing this, I made the first prototype of my MM3 box. It&#39;s falling short of the quality I want to have before I start giving them away, but it&#39;s a start. The goal is to have it hold 3 pens, and multiples should stack nicely. Why 3 pens you ask? I&#39;m glad you did, but there isn&#39;t a satisfying answer. I just like the number 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;re going on a writing retreat anywhere in the world—where would you go, what would you write, and what would you write with?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not one much for traveling. I&#39;ve been out of the country 2 times in my life, but each time they were not initiated by me. I think if I could choose, I&#39;d pick some place with a cool ocean breeze and warm sun. The holdup is that I would want a writing setup like Roald Dahl’s. So if there is some way to integrate a warm, but not too warm beach, with a comfy chair and lapdesk I&#39;m all over it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For pens, I&#39;d bring my matte black Vanishing Point with EF filled with Pilot Namiki black, and for paper I&#39;d choose a Midori MD A5 notebook. I&#39;m not a very complicated or interesting person. While I&#39;ve dabbled with more colorful and interesting options, I seem to always come back to black ink and a fine line.</p>
<p>What&#39;s a current or favorite creative outlet?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m loving writing &#39;Morning Pages&#39;, although they are mostly &#39;Through the Day Pages.&#39; I can&#39;t really find time to sit for 20–30 min and write. I also have an issue writing for long stretches due to an injury. Other than that, woodworking and CAD designing are always a joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#39;s something that causes you benign envy—the kind of admiration and desire that leads to inspiration or motivation?</p>
<ul>
<li>When I see others be able to talk eloquently, or get things to fit just right and make it seem eloquent. Even way back in my middle school age when I skateboarded, I had a style that was determined &#39;sketchy.&#39; This style carried forward into my musical playing style where I hit the notes, not bad or wrong, but not clean (somewhat good in jazz). So, in another sense I&#39;m envious of individuals who can make things where even the details are clean. It drives me to clean up my act and nail things 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#39;s a comfort item, material, or color?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a blanket that my sister made for me when I was 10. It might well be my longest-used item. It is ragged and falling apart, but I still enjoy curling up with it with my dog on my lap and reading a book. I also adore the stark contrast of a matte black pen on a white piece of paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>What would be a dream collaboration, project, or partnership?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh goodness, I&#39;m not much for collaborations or partnerships. I&#39;ve yet to figure out how to play well with others. As far as projects, being commissioned to build people custom pen cabinets would be a dream come true. I&#39;ve even started planning one for a certain penfluencer as a thank you gift.</li>
