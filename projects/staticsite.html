<p>I prompted ChatGPT to get me started. I wanted to know the basic structure of HTML. It had been a while since I coded in plain HTML, and the entire goal of this site is to be quick and easy.</p>
<p>It gave me a simple scaffold — <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. I remembered that much, so it wasn't a huge help.</p>
<p>The simplicity is the point. I don’t want to maintain a CMS. I don’t want to wait for anything to compile. I want to write, paste in a link or an embed, and move on. Static HTML means I can open a file, make a change, and refresh the browser. </p>
<p>The site itself is on <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netifly</a>, specifically because of the low cost, and I don't anticipate any REAL traffic to it.</p>
<p>After years now of writing in Obsidian, Drafts, and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> compatible editors, my brain kinda thinks in that way. So I've also created a markdown to HTML python script. <a href="https://markdowntohtml.com/">There are many online</a> but another small project was creating the script. With the script, I can continue to write in Obsidian, and upload the converted file to Github via VSCODE.</p>
